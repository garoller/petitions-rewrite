                <p>This version of RPI Petitions is the collaborative effort of members of the Rensselaer Center for Open Source (RCOS) and Student Senate.</p>
                <p>We created this site with the hope that all RPI students can spark and encourage change, regardless of size.</p>

                <p>Curious about creating a new petition? Here are some steps to help get you started.</p>
                <blockquote class="blockquote rule">Have an Idea.</blockquote>
                <p>Search for petitions that match your concerns. If a petition for your issue already exists, sign it! This will help raise support for your cause and reach the amount of signatures needed to gain Senate support (250, as of 03/13/2015).</p>
                <hr>
                <blockquote class="blockquote rule">Write your Petition.</blockquote>
                    <p>
                        <a href="#">Create a Petition</a> if your issue hasnâ€™t been raised. Use proper grammar and spelling, and make your description clear so that others can easily find your petition. Be sure to review our <a href="#moderation">Moderation Policy</a> before posting.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-danger">Be careful! You can't edit or delete a petition once it is submitted. </p>
                <hr>
                <blockquote class="blockquote rule">Share your Petition</blockquote>
                    <p>Use social media to spread awareness of your issue!</p>
                    <p> A petition has one year to reach its threshold. If the threshold is not reached, then the petition is archived. You can still search for said petition, but you will be unable to sign it. Student Senate may elect to address a petition prior to reaching its threshold.</p>
