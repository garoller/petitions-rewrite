                <p>Curious about creating a new petition? Here are some steps to help get you started!</p>
                <blockquote class="blockquote bg-light text-center pontiac">Have an Idea!</blockquote>
                <p>Search for petitions that match your concerns. If a petition for your issue already exists, sign it! This will help raise support for your cause and reach the amount of signatures needed to gain Senate support (250, as of 03/13/2015).</p>
                <hr>
                <blockquote class="blockquote bg-light text-center pontiac">Write your Petition!</blockquote>
                    <p>
                        <a href="{% url 'create' %}">Create a petition</a> if your issue hasnâ€™t been raised. Use proper grammar and spelling, and make your description clear so that others can easily find your petition. Be sure to review our Moderation Policy (located on the right-most tab of this page) before posting.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-danger">Be careful! You can't edit or delete a petition once it has been submitted. </p>

                    <p> A petition has one year to reach its threshold. If the threshold is not reached, then the petition is archived. You can still search for said petition, but you will be unable to sign it. Student Senate may elect to address a petition prior to reaching its threshold.</p>
